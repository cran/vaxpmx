Description: Estimate vaccine efficacy (VE) using immunogenicity data.
    The inclusion of immunogenicity data in regression models can increase precision in VE. 
    The methods are described in the publications "Elucidating vaccine efficacy using a correlate of protection, demographics, and logistic regression" and "Improving precision of vaccine efficacy evaluation using immune correlate data in time-to-event models" by Julie Dudasova, Zdenek Valenta, and Jeffrey R. Sachs (2024).
